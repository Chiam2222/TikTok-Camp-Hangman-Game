# TikTok-Camp-Hangman-Game
This is a TikTok youth camp project where we created a hangman game as a group

How to play the game:
1. Enter a letter to start the game
2. If the entered word is wrong, one stroke of hangman will be created; if the letter entered is correct the letter will show on the screen
3. Guess the words using clues from correct and wrong letters entered

In my js code, I make it in a way such that when the user enter twice of the same letter, the game will prompt the user "You have already entered the letter" so that the user knows that the letter they are trying to enter have already been entered before. 
The game will also show the letters that are wrong on the screen. When the hangman is fully created before the user guess the word, it will prompt "Unfortunately you lost." and a "Play Again" button will be shown. When the user guess the word correctly before the full hangman is created, it will prompt "Congratulations! You won! ðŸ˜ƒ" and a "Play Again" button will be shown. If the user wants to play again, they could just click on the play again button to start another round of game.
